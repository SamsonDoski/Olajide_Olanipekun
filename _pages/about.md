## Technical Experience

### Trading Assistant (Python)

I developed a Python-based back-testing and portfolio simulation tool to evaluate moving average crossover strategies. The system accurately replicated historical trade signals and achieved a 100% execution success rate during testing. The tool was validated through simulated trading trials with 20+ active users and received a 92% approval rating for signal accuracy and capital allocation recommendations.

### Bank Simulation (C++)

Built a C++ program simulating real-world banking transactions using structured programming principles. The system implemented multiple functional components and achieved consistent execution reliability across all test runs.
